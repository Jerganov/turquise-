Next Steps (Refined Project Outline)
Define Game Flow

Player gets market scenarios (chart + news event).

Player makes a trading decision (buy/sell/hold).

System evaluates decision using RL logic.

Reward or penalty applied → player score updated.

Data Handling

Start with historical datasets (CSV files of stock prices + news headlines).

Later, integrate APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, NewsAPI).

Ensure API calls are asynchronous to avoid lag.

Reinforcement Learning Setup

Define states (market conditions, player portfolio).

Define actions (buy/sell/hold).

Define rewards (profit/loss, risk exposure).

Prototype RL logic in Python → port to C++ once stable.

Game Engine & UI

Use SFML or SDL2 for rendering charts, menus, and decisions.

Keep UI simple: candlestick chart + decision buttons.

Persistence

Store player progress in JSON/SQLite.

Optional: leaderboard if multiplayer.

Testing & Iteration

Simulate multiple scenarios with mock data.

Gradually add real-time API integration.

Optimize RL loop for performance.

📝 My Recommendation
Start small: Build a prototype with historical data and simple reward logic.

Expand gradually: Add APIs and reinforcement learning once the core game loop works.

Keep it fun: Don’t let the technical complexity overshadow the gameplay.



Your project idea is Advanced (upper undergraduate / early professional level).

Why? It combines multiple domains:

Game development (engine, UI, player interaction).

Data science/ML (reinforcement learning).

Systems programming (C++ performance, API integration).

Software engineering (database, modular design).

🧭 Recommendation
Treat this as a capstone-style project or portfolio centerpiece.

Start with a scaled-down prototype (historical data, simple reward system).

Gradually add real-time APIs and reinforcement learning.

Document each stage — this will show employers/interviewers your ability to handle complexity step by step.
